    "**Goal:** Conduct a basic aspect-based sentiment analysis on airlines with the [aspect-based-sentiment-analysis (ABSA) package](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "The (airline) aspects in focus are:\n",
    "- Seat\n",
    "- Cabin staff service\n",
    "- Food\n",
    "- Inflight entertainment\n",
    "- Ground service\n",
    "- WiFi\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip to the code if you are not interested in a brief discussion of the eventual ABSA process. This can also easily be inferred from the code**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ABSA process\n",
    "To conduct the ABSA, aspect classes (enumerated above) are manually indicated as well as terms that are likely linked to these e.g. food: meal, food.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These aspect terms are then searched for in the review text and if they exist, the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the word is inferred from the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation\n",
    "To evaluate the efficacy/accuracy of the ABSA, we utilized one of the preprocessed datasets. In this dataset, the airline aspects (enumerated above) ratings (from 1-5) were mapped to categorical sentiment groups thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1-2: Negative \\ \\ | \\ \\ \\ 3: Neutral \\ \\ \\ | \\ \\ \\  4-5: Positive$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, aspect predictions where the model found no aspect term were replaced with NaNs. For example, if the mapping of ratings to sentiment groups in a particular review reported food as being 'Positive' and the model did not find food to be discussed in this same review, then the sentiment ('Positive') for that review is replaced with a NaN. This is done so that the model's predictions are all that are evaluated and not cases where the model does not predict. There are a few reasons/assumptions behind this action:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users reviews do not always cover what they rated as these are two different sections on the review website (i.e. the review is not necessarily exhaustive). Hence, there is no way for the model to deduce what the reviewer thought of an aspect if it was not actually expressed in the review (hence why the rated sentiment is replaced with a NaN since that sentiment was not expressed in the review)\n",
    "2. In some sense, we are putting too much faith in the model. It is possible that the reviewer did express sentiment on the aspect but the model did not catch this. In this case, we still go with the model and believe that the service aspect (e.g. food, cabin crew, etc.) was not discussed in the review text. *This point is especially important since the aspect terms were specified manually and certain terms could definitely have been missed out*."
