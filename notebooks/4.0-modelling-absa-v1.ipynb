      "johannesburg to durban. i have always preferred using south african airways for flights within south africa but this flight has been very disappointing. i was traveling with my 5 year old daughter alone and coming after a night with very little sleep and a day of continuous flying a flight on time would have been much appreciated, but that was not to be we stood in line at the embarkation gate for over half an hour with no explanation on the delay and no estimated time of departure. my little one needed to go toilet and i tried to get any information on the tine without an answer so i had to get her out of line and take her to toilet losing or spot and ending up at the back of the line. when we board i find out that we had been seated separately and not one of the flight attendants tried to explain to passengers to help us sit together the little girl was crying quietly seated next to a strange woman. i will think twice about flying on this airline again. \n",

      "madrid to casablanca. excellent experience; this was my first time flying royal air maroc, and i am very pleased with them.  the aircraft arrived to the gate on time, and we boarded and departed on time. the seats were clean and comfortable. one of the things that very pleasantly surprised me is that, despite the fact that this flight is barely 1.5 hours, the flight attendants served a delicious, hot meal, complete with beverages. you'll never get anything more than peanuts or pretzels on a domestic flight in america, so imagine my surprise! the flight attendants were polite, friendly, and courteous. the in-flight entertainment was displayed on drop-down screens (old school charlie chaplin, so it was family friendly), but i wasn't going to complain about the lack of entertainment options on this short of a flight. you can also access wifi on your phone, so there are definitely some options. the plane ride was smooth, and there were no issues with debarking and picking up my luggage. overall, i am very pleased with my experience, and highly recommend my family, friends, and others to fly with royal air maroc. i will definitely be flying with them in the near future. \n",
