0,ethiopian-airlines,2021-01-31 00:08:00,i've flown ethiopian airlines a couple of times and have been generally satisfied. not the best but better than many. i recently flew from add to iad. this was a horrible flight. 1) a flight attendant was serving water in the cabin (nice since they confiscated all water bottles before boarding). i was seated in the back of a cabin. she ran out of water and never came back. who cares? 2) the food and beverage service was absolutely the slowest i've ever seen in my life (out of about 100 trans-atlantic flights). you would have had to work hard to go any slower. there were two flight attendants serving - and two standing around doing absolutely nothing. i have never see a lazier group of flight attendants in my life. 3) the food was worse than bad - inedible. the beef was nothing but grizzle and fat - i wouldn't serve this to my dog. no plan or organization for service - none. terrible flight. among the worst flights i've been on. the cabin crew was lazy beyond words. avoid this airline if at all possible.,Business,Economy Class,August 2021,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,0

2,ethiopian-airlines,2021-01-29 00:07:00,my children are stuck in transit in ethiopia as ethiopian airlines keeps delaying their next flight. they told the children that it’s because of weather but many planes are arriving and departing no worries so the weather excuse is obviously a lie. now it’s over 12 hours! they have now missed their connecting flights and ethiopian staff are refusing to help book new flights for them or pay for new connecting flights with the airline of the connecting flights which they missed. disgusting. did not even give the children a hotel to rest in even though they delayed the flight for over 12 hours.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,July 2021,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,0

79,ethiopian-airlines,2019-01-06 00:03:00,"ethiopian airlines is a world class airline, comparable to emirates. plus, they’re half the price of emirates. i recently flew ultra-long haul 23 hours each way from bangkok to buenos aires and returning from newark. both flights had two stops for crew changes. check in at bangkok airport seems disorganised and the location of the check in counters which are next to el al means you are checking in next to armed security personnel which gives an uncomfortable feeling. my hopes went up when i visited the eva air lounge which was very good. boarding was extremely disorganised, they shouted out business class passengers but i was blocked by other passengers from entering the gate. we had the older business class product which is similar to turkish airlines a330, but compressed into a smaller cabin. you had a choice of mimosa, champagne or orange juice on boarding, and the cabin was 50-75% full on all flights. after a late night departure, only three passengers chose to have dinner, so there was no excuse for slow service. within an hour after takeoff, i had enjoyed a very good late night meal. they plate the food on board the aircraft and place individual elements on the tray table, rather than bringing it out on a tray. after which, i slept like a baby on their comfortable seat. a comfortable quilt is provided, business class quality, but the pillow is too small. transfer in addis ababa is messy, but you manage to get through somehow. the cloud nine lounge is one of the most unique i have ever experienced, and instead of doing an ear-wrenching pa a lounge attendant walks around shouting different destinations which are ready for boarding. i felt this was acceptable as they didn’t want people missing their flights. i thoroughly enjoyed a six-course meal on the flight to são paulo, including some local dishes. one thing they do right on ethiopian is every chicken dish i’ve had has always been moist and not dried out. great job on that! the crew were courteous and well-trained. they were more than willing to go the extra mile. there were enough movies to keep me entertained for all flights. the return from newark just proved to me they are better than emirates. the flight was delayed due to weather and late arrival, so when they announced the delay i asked if i could wait in the business class lounge. the gate agent said she would pick us up and whisk us through when the flight was ready to board. sure enough, 30 minutes later, the gate agent comes and sees me and whisks me and other business class passengers through a very crowded boarding area. the flight was delayed three hours due to de-icing and weather, and by the time we got to addis ababa, we literally had five minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave. no problem, they whisked all tight connections onto a bus and drove us straight to the plane, and i was literally the last passenger to board the plane. all these little details clearly make ethiopian airlines a world class airline. when i re-read their website, they define their cloud nine as “a mix between first and business class.” i can very clearly see elements in the soft product which accounts for first class service. the hard product is still business class, to be fair. i would have no hesitation in flying ethiopian again at all.",Family Leisure,Business Class,March 2019,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,,Positive,1

507,egyptair,2015-01-04 00:06:00,i consistently use egyptair to visit family in france and the uk. it is my favourite airline because of the comparatively low ticket prices ability to change route and dates on tickets on even the cheapest tickets (also refundable) booked directly with the airline and the 46kg baggage allowance where other airlines only permit 20kg. the cai-cdg and cai-lhr routes are mostly served by newer airbus 330s which are vastly superior to the old boeing 777s. pay attention to the aircraft type which is displayed when booking on the egyptair site. i would not travel on a 777 with a young baby for instance as there is nowhere to place the bassinet except on the floor by your feet and they do not allow you to bring a car seat. there are also no infant seat belts as they claim these are unsafe. the 330 in contrast is pretty comfortable with a wide choice of inflight entertainment and good leg room in the front row. food is fine. kids meals are larger than the adult meals and are usually pasta with tomato sauce plus grilled chicken breast. adult meals are bread roll plus butter with a main meal of rice plus meat plus sauce. you have a choice of red meat chicken or fish. the dessert is usually inedible and 80s looking. staff have always been polite and accommodating especially when i was flying alone with young children. it is certainly not a premium airline but if cost and flexibility matter to you then i would recommend them for shorter flights. take care always to book directly with them though so tickets are refundable.,,Economy Class,,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,,,Positive,1

1250,tunisair,2015-01-14 00:07:00,tunis-lhr economy - tunisair check-in is awful. we were a group of seven and for a 30% occupancy they spent over an hour with three different check-in staff finding seats together. but in flight was good. tunisair catering was on strike but the alternative meal service was rather good (no alcohol) and tasty hot lunch provided. old seats in the cabin but very comfortable and a lot of leg room. good cabin crew and excellent newspapers and in-flight magazine.,Business,Economy Class,July 2015,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,,Neutral,1
1251,tunisair,2015-01-01 00:07:00,"we flew business class on tunisair on a business trip to tunis and had a good flight. a319 on fra-tun had business class seats , the crew was always on hand and the lounge in fra was comfortable and a good choice of food and drinks. during the flight a selection of beverages was available free of charge and the crew offered additional drinks several times. the snack was a little small for the business class price, only a sandwich and a piece of cake was served. the flight back was good also, but there were no business class seats - just economy class seating with free middle seat. the lounge in tunis is not the most comfortable but it does its job. the crew was friendly. only minus point here: no food due to problems at tunis airport (we were informed at the lounge so we had some snacks there). all in all we had two good flights and would use tunisair again.",Business,Business Class,June 2015,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,,Positive,1
1252,tunisair,2015-01-20 00:05:00,i don't usually bother with reviews i fly so frequently worldwide so figure on average you'll get a few bad ones but felt compelled to spread the word this time. it was the first and will be the last time i would fly anywhere with this airline. check in for both flights met with miserable uncommunicative staff who clearly don't want to be at work ancient filthy aircraft you start having serious thoughts about safety surly lazy cabin crew food offerings look so inedible you don't bother opening the plastic packaging 3.5 hour delay on return flight from tunis to london no updates or explanations just wait wait wait at the gate in the grimy surroundings that appear to be the norm for tunisair. customer service is not a concept they understand.,,Business Class,,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,,,Negative,0
1253,tunisair,2015-01-19 00:04:00,this is not my first review on tunis air but since the closure of the london-tunis flight on ba this is the only scheduled direct service from the uk right now. departed on the tu790 on the 06th april. the flight was over 2 hours late arriving into london on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the std. outbound aircraft (ts-imh) was very old (1994) and extremely dirty inside. the cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight. meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks. the most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded. the cabin crew (6 members) were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers. the return flight that i took on the 13th april as the return leg (tu791) was operated by a much newer (2013) aeroplane (ts-imv). however again clearly tunis air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in tunis airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs? at least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier. unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight. tunis air are under increasing pressure i am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time. however if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then i do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once ezy start their service from stn-mir in june i will be switching my business to them.,,Economy Class,,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,,,Negative,0
1254,tunisair,2015-01-09 00:03:00,heathrow-tunis-heathrow. outward the plane was on time. the staff did not manage one smile between them. the food was appalling (no starter just chicken and couscous plus an industrial bit of cake) the wine had run out and there was only one beer left. return flight was worse. cabin crew still could not muster a smile. flight was delayed over 45 minutes because of late passengers so we missed our coach connection from heathrow. there was no food at all because we were told once on board there was a caterer's strike. since they knew there was a strike why did they not make other arrangements? why didn't they give passengers vouchers to buy food at the terminal? why did they not even tell passengers at check-in there would be no food then we could have bought our own? truly a bad airline.,,Economy Class,,Neutral,Negative,Negative,,,,Negative,0
1255,tunisair,2015-01-28 00:01:00,tunis-amsterdam tu 638 23/12/2014. very good no frills airline. mostly on time. apparently with delays on some airports like lhr might be a uk problem. decent food. nice personnel. i like that one pays a decent fare and one way is half of round-trip.,,Economy Class,,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,,,Positive,1
