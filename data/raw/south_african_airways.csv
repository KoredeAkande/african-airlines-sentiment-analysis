2,south-african-airways,2020-01-20 00:04:00,True,"I arrived to Johannesburg on an international flight on 26 March 2020, which was the last day before lockdown in South Africa. Due to the lockdown, most domestic airlines already stopped flying on the 25th. This seat in Business Class on SAA was the only option I had to get back to Cape Town, as US$275 one way for the 2 hour flight. When I arrived at the Business check in counters it was like the airline had already shut down. I went over to the Economy check in area and again there were no passengers and no staff. I turned to walk away, and that is when I saw 3 check in agents dragging themselves back to checkin. The explanation offered was that things were quiet, so they all decided to take a lunch break together. After I was checked in, I enquired about the lounge, as this was a business class ticket, however I was informed that the SAA lounge was closed due to the lockdown. Fine, I understand that they need some time to shut things down, but how about offering a voucher for a coffee and a sandwich like any respectable airline would do? I did pay full fare after all. I enquired about this at the ticket counter, but the very agent told me that ""there are no contingencies in place for the lounge. When I stated that normally a voucher would be offered, he became defensive and started telling me that he was about to lose his job. The flight boarded on time. This was probably the only thing they did right. After everyone was on board, we waited for a good 30 minutes while the crew kept telling us that ""there were more passengers on the way"", and that we needed to wait for them. No boarding refreshments were offered in Business. Eventually the person we were waiting for boarded the aircraft, and no, this was not a passenger at all it was a cabin crew. The business cabin on this A320 showed serious signs or wear.  On my seat, the cover for the lifejacket in the central armrest would not stay shut as the catch was broken. We took off about 45 minutes late.  Shortly after take off, the crew made an announcement: ""due to the Coronavirus, we will not be serving lunch today. Instead you will each find juice in your seat pocket."" That was it for the service.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Johannesburg to Cape Town,March 2020,1.0,no,A320,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,

7,south-african-airways,2020-01-20 00:03:00,True,I asked for champagne on board which every airlines serve on business class but SA doesn't. They don't have menu to choose from. The cabin crew comes and take your order and they only have 2 options to choose from. In flight entertainment is poor. Their worldwide call centers are the most terrible one I've ever came across. I was trying to change my date from Accra to Washington. I contacted the Accra office 3 times. Someone picked the call then hangs up as if I'm disturbing their peace. I contacted Johannesburg office and I was placed on hold for 30 mins until I ran out of airtime credit. I called back again and after being on hold for 25 mins a customer service rep came on the phone and placed me on hold again for another 30 mins until I hanged up. I called the Washington office and again I was placed on hold for one hour until someone answered then she placed me on hold after taking for my booking code. She kept me on hold for 1.5hrs and never returned to me. As I write this review I'm still on hold waiting to talk to someone because my flight takes off tomorrow and I need to do these changes before tomorrow. My husband is also on hold for 2 hrs hoping someone answers his call so he can talk to them on my behalf. It's quite expensive to call from Africa and I spent over $60 buying airtime credit just to call SA customer service but to no avail. What a horrible customer service and airline. This is my second time flying SA and I'm done with them. I'll advise my friends and family and everyone to stay away from this horrible airline. It's been 2.5hrs now and I'm still on hold.

8,south-african-airways,2020-01-17 00:03:00,True,"Accra to Washington Dulles. Given the current situation globally, just glad that I got home. South African Airways is way below current standards for business class. My seat arm rest was broken and wouldn't collapse. This took about 6 inches off my sleeping space. My food was unappealing and limited options. Even though it is a flight with a late departure with only a light meal offered for dinner, I found that I was hungry after that service and there were not even biscuits or any sort of snack available. Service was obliging but seems their company has left crew with limited options to satisfy their premium cabin customers. Flight departed and arrived on time.

9,south-african-airways,2020-01-12 00:03:00,True,"Washington to Accra in business class. South African Airways uses TK lounge in Dulles which was jam packed with line ups for the washrooms. Boarding smooth with early departure from IAD. I was initially in 2A, but moved to 9K in the second business class cabin when I saw some kids a couple rows behind me. Big mistake because there was a young woman two rows behind me who wanted everyone to know that she was there and travelling in business class. She fussed over everything, talked loudly from her seat to a passenger behind her, flirted shamelessly with the male cabin crew and in the middle of the flight, when everyone else was asleep, talked a full volume in the galley. I had to get and tell the crew to tell her to shut the hell up. To no avail. Then, on final approach to ACC, she was sound asleep and couldn't be woken up. She was a complete idiot. At one point, she stood in the second galley and pointed to the first, larger business class cabin and announced, ""that must be business class, but where I am (the smaller second business class cabin) must be first class because it is small"". A complete idiot. Shame on the crew for letting her talk so loudly in the galley in the middle of the night. Service was ok but definitely no way near the standard of many airlines. The business cabin was just over half full, but the crew did the minimum possible. When I inquired as to how the seat is made up for sleeping, one FA just pointed at the two packages of blankets/padded cover and said, ""there they are"", as if I hadn't already seen them. No effort at all to help prepare my seat for sleeping. During the meal service, when it was time for dessert, I was asked what I wanted. I said I'd have the cheesecake and the cheese plate, then was told that it was 'company policy' that I could have one or the other. Really? In business class with a nearly half-empty cabin? Food was mediocre overall. I liked the bulkhead seat in the second cabin (row 9) because the foot area is double size, unlike a lot of the new coffin-like business seats where you feel like you are undergoing the world's longest MRI.",Business,Business Class,Washington to Accra,March 2020,4.0,yes,A330,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
10,south-african-airways,2020-01-06 00:03:00,True,"On March 5, we were scheduled to depart at 1 p.m. from Livingston to Johannesburg on Flight SA49. But, without warning, the airline cancelled the flight, and all passengers were transferred to the swing flight SA9040/SA41, which we had to fly from Livingston to Victoria Fall, and only then to Johannesburg. Since we had to catch a flight from Johannesburg to Istanbul at 7:15 p.m., we requested confirmation of the cancellation of the flight in order to return the money, buy other tickets and fly off a normal flight of another airline, British Airways. A Nsw representative from SA refused to do so, assuring us that we would arrive in Johannesburg just 1.5 hours later than the originally set arrival time (15:15 instead of 14:45). That was still enough to catch our plane from Johannesburg at 7:15 p.m. We were denied the return of tickets and sent to board the plane, where we and other passengers were simply blocked for several hours. The plane did not take off at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. First they sorted the luggage, then it turned out that they did not have a flight permit to fly to Victoria Fall. At the same time, we were not allowed back from the plane and were physically deprived of the opportunity to fly on a flight of another airline, British Airways, which took off from Livingston on schedule at 13:30 and arrived in time for Johannesburg. As a result, we flew to Johannesburg at 6:25 p.m., 3 hours 40 minutes late than the scheduled arrival time. Despite the assurances of the crew that we would be helped to board our flight at 19:15 through the transfer corridor, this was not done. We were just escorted out of the plane and dumped at the airport. When we independently found the South african Airways office at Johannesburg airport and asked us to issue a certificate about the late arrival of the flight due to the fault of the airline, we were rude, our passport was taken away and did not want to give it away. To get the document back, we had to call the police. After that, immediately returned the passport and issued the required certificate. As a result, we lost our flight to Istanbul at 19:15, were forced to purchase tickets for alternative flights at our own expense. One of the passengers became ill at the SA (South African Airways) office, but the spokeswoman refused to call a doctor. The reason for the situation was the greed of South African Airways, which instead of two planes (the airline sold two flights to Johannesburg - from Livingston and from Victoria Fall) sent one plane, which was supposed to gallop around Victoria Falls, picking up and unloading passengers of two flights. At the same time, the airline did not even have permission to fly under such a scheme, but knowing that the flight in time is impossible, denied passengers their law the right to return tickets and tricked them to the plane, which was doomed to fly with great delay. The fact that the airline has problems is already written in the media. But perhaps it's time to stop selling tickets for flights that no airline is going to perform? We are preparing to sue for compensation for late services, denial of the right by law to a forced return of an cancelled/altered flight, and for leaving a passenger in danger in a state threatening his health, an official of South African Airways and refusal to call for medical assistance.

Some people were stuck in a reclined position while others were stuck upright when it was time to sleep. On the returning flight, the TV screens were hardly responsive to touch and were very frustrating to use. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, if a passenger is seated next to a window, they can't step around or over their seatmate when the latter is in a reclined position. This means they have to wake up their seatmate to go to the bathroom, etc. The seat spaces are fairly cramped. For both SAA flights, I had to store my handbag in the overhead compartment for takeoff and landing. On the flight to JFK, they ran out of eggs for breakfast. This has never happened to me before. On the return flight for lunch, they ran out of salmon.  On the departing flight, the flight attendant took away my untouched serving of butter and then, when I asked for butter later, said that each passenger is allocated only 1 serving of butter.  Apart from the desserts, I found the food  not that much better than what's served in economy class. For most of the departing flight, there was  one overworked flight attendant serving our section, which meant that the service was very slow and they were not always prompt and sometimes forgot to offer hot towels, blankets, etc. I must say that my returning flight was much better in terms of service, quality, food, etc.) The lounge in OR Tambo is okay but a little chaotic, and the food looked unappetizing.

As the airline is struggling financially, I would have though it can't afford to alienate premium customers, but henceforth, if a flight is operated with an A319, I'll downgrade to Economy and save a small fortune. Serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly. Most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne.

We reserved 3 seats for the trip going to New York and our return flight back to JHB. Before boarding this flight I phoned SAA and raised my concerns about on board entertainment systems being faulty which were laid to rest by your call centre lady saying I must request the ground staff to check entertainment systems before we take off to see if our systems are working so if there are technical problems they can be sorted before the plane hits the runway then it would be too late. This however did not prove to be factual at all. Once at the terminal the staff on the plane were rude and told us the systems could not be checked until the plane was in the air. So we sat back and waited hoping all would be okay until the emergency demonstration had been done and the entertainment systems started getting switched on then we started to see the overhead lights coming on one after the other. At this time we were still trying to figure out how to pull our entertainment systems from under our seats. With our luck Seat 45D had a picture but no sound. Seat 45E and 45F no picture or sound. So we complained with the other 20 or odd passengers at the time so they announced they were going to reboot the system. This happened twice. No change. The plane was not full so they started to move passengers around to seats to where there were screens to see if they could find available entertainment. My friend was moved twice and then gave up due to not being successful and came back to her seat next to me. The air was so hot where we were sitting we could not take it another minute so we called the air hostess who said she could not understand why it would only be our row. She came back later and said afterwards that there was a distinct temperature difference between the rest of the plane and our section and she would try and resolve it for us. She was very apologetic and accommodating. We were hoping that our return flight would be on a different plane as we checked and saw SAA has a few of these planes on their fleet and thought the likelihood of getting such bad luck a second time running in one trip would be unheard of.

Based on my previous experiences with them, I had explored other alternatives with a superior product (Qatar, Emirates and several EU carriers), but SAA is the only airline serving JFK non stop out of Johannesburg and I could not afford traveling 1-2 days vs the 15h direct flight. Having flown to and back from New York with them last week, I regret my choice for the following reasons:  Airport services: OKish, uneventful check-in and boarding experience. SAA flies their old A340 600 to New York. Even though I purchased an emergency exit seat on both legs (45D, 45F resp) and had a very decent legroom, the experience was not pleasant as the seats were hard as a rock (even with lumbar support and additional pillows) and the aircraft clearly showed its age and it felt like its interior was falling apart.  Inflight Entertainment more than half of the passengers travelling on my row complained about technical issues with their IFE system. Some of them simply didn't work, others like mine worked but with lag and poor sound. Not great when you have a 15h flight ahead of you. Cabin crew service: I did see a slight improvement vs. previous flights as crew seemed a bit nicer and more customer oriented.

I have read many bad reviews of South African Airways so I was pleasantly surprised with our experience on board. Economy seats were comfortable, with sufficient legroom and recline. The only issue being the excessively stiff seat pocket. Anything thicker than a magazine is difficult to stow. On the flight to London we were given dinner and breakfast plus a good selection of drinks. Food choices were OK and if your choice was not in their cart the FA's were happy to find the meal in another cart if they could. They went out of their way to help. Service was generally very friendly, polite and efficient. Cabin crew seemed to be enjoying their job too, which makes a change from the sullen service on some European carriers. Inflight entertainment selections were a bit dated but OK. The major problem was sound quality. On this flight the movie voice soundtrack at my seat was completely garbled (though the music track was fine). Perhaps the different language tracks were interfering. As I mainly wanted to sleep on this overnight flight this was not a big loss. Overall I was satisfied by SAA's inflight service, it was way above expectation.

I will start with a few positives about the experience: The staff are personable and the meal service is conducted quickly to allow the maximum sleep time on the JNB-LHR route. Access is provided to an arrivals lounge, which is essential as the airlines serves only powdered coffee. Now for the many negatives, these relate primarily to the seat and to the airline's schedule instability. The aircraft was the advertised A330-200. These are widely marketed as lie-flats by the airline and independent websites, however they are angled at about 170 deg and uncomfortable for sleeping. SAA is rare in having a different Business Class seating product on each long-haul aircraft type and also unusual to go from the extremely comfortable and 2-metre long long lie-flats on the A340-600 back to an angled version. The schedule is unstable. I was booked on SA354 at 17.05. SAA did not inform either my travel agent or me of the change in flight plans, it was only by chance that I had wifi access and attempted an online check-in to notice we had been rebooked on SA346 at 15.00. This flight operates 2 hours earlier than our original booking. For much of our trip we were in the bush and off grid so would have missed the flight if we had been coming from elsewhere. This lack of communication of a significant flight change is terrible, as we would have missed the flight had we turned up for a 17.05 departure. On check-in it became apparent that the SA352 at 16.05 was cancelled and passengers being moved from SA352 to SA354. However, a 5-hour wait at JNB was not expected or particularly welcome and no attempt was made to move us to the earlier SA234 from JNB to LHR. Staff professionalism - staff chatted in the galleys throughout the night on both LHR flights, which disrupted sleep despite ear plugs. Furthermore, my request if a snack might be available before the breakfast service commenced, only to be told there are no snacks on board.

I informed, on the same day that I bought such tickets, that there was a little error in the passenger name, and I asked what would be the procedure in this case. It was a material and irrelevant error, I just had written his middle name with an extra “r”. In the e-mail dated 26 September 2017 sent by the Reservations Service Recovery team as described herein, they confirmed that the error in the name would not be a problem and also informed the occurance of a schedule change on our flight, as transcribed below: “Kindly be advised that we have endorsed on the system for the airport to allow passenger to board. Please note that there has been a schedule change on your flight from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg.” Unfortunately, on flight day when I tried to do the kid's check in at the airport, I was informed that his ticket was cancelled, although his seat was still booked in the system. We know that because I did my check in and my girlfriend's check in online one day before the flight and kid's seat was there. South African employee informed us that his ticket was cancelled, because the name was wrong and the company policy sets forth that the ticket must be automatically cancelled. However, I did not receive any e-mail about such cancellation. And also we confirmed five months ago with the company if the error in kid’s name would represent a problem and the answer was no, as I mentioned above. The employee at the airport said that the ticket was cancelled and refunded and she could not do anything about it. The wrong information of South African Airways employee, and the lack of cancelation notice cost us 3.281,89 Rand, almost four times more than the ticket that I originally paid for the kid to travel with us. I still want to understand why his ticket was cancelled and once cancelled why I did not receive a notice about it. We were on vacations and we booked two days in Sun City Hotel. So I did not have other choice than buy another ticket to the kid by a huge price. I look foward to their return. The ticket was arbitrarily cancelled. We were badlly guided by South African's team regarding the error in the kids name and the cancelation of his ticket. It cost us more 2.465,80 Rand.

We get onto the aircraft, we find that my wife's seat belt installed incorrectly very much to her discomfort which they could not fix. The electronics in my seat played up which they could not fix either. On the flight to Hong Kong the temprature setting was far too high and cabin staff ignored the request to lower it. The food selection was bland and of very poor quality. No selection of newpapers or magazine - the racks remained empty on both flights. On the return flight my inflight entertainment system broke down in the middle of the movie I was watching. They could not fix. Overall the seats in business class are worn and and the same applies to the blankets and bed mat that cabin crew hand out. After dinner service the Cabin Crew is nowhere to be seen  - when I went behind the galley where the door to the cockpit is siuated I actually found a signboard which read ""Silence Cabin Crew resting"".

But 3 flights in a row I have had the worst customer experience, and what pushed it over the edge was my flight being cancelled 2 days before Christmas. They knew the flight would not take off from Heathrow when I checked in at 5pm but checked all their passengers in without telling them the flight had been cancelled, and only when they were at the gate ready to board did they inform everyone the flight was cancelled. They gave us an empty promise of EU compensation which they fully knew didn’t apply to the situation we were in, which we all found out afterwards when we tried to receive compensation for the delay. If they had told me when I had checked in at 5pm I could have made alternative arrangement to fly back to SA without missing my connection flight, but they made sure we were all checked in and couldn’t catch any other flights out and only told us the flight was cancelled at 8:30pm. Long story short it was shocking customer service, with very little help and assistance, and ended up costing me £300+ extra to pay for accommodation and changing flights to get home on Christmas day, more than a day later then I should have arrived home. SAA have taken no accountability for the lack of service and communication and refuse to reimburse me for part of my costs incurred. I have been a loyal SAA voyager member for over 20 years, as I want to support my home airline. But I can quite honestly say I will never fly SAA again.

Aircraft seemed very dated and in need of an upgrade on the interior. Seats did not seem very ergonomic and tray tables did not have any conveniences like a coat/jacket hook. Still had the double headphone port on the seat handle so very difficult to get in and out of seat when people wanted to go to the bathroom. Sound kept going off and kept requesting the attendants help but they could not resolve the issue. Screens on the TVs are ancient and very dark. One of the most frustrating things is undoubtedly the cabin announcements - the sound goes off but your video keeps playing and the announcement comes through your headphones blaring at a higher volume than you were watching at - you have to quickly remove the headphones until the announcements are done. When the seat in front reclines you have almost no room unless you recline as well and have to tilt the screen quite a bit. Bathroom ergonomics were also very poor - cramped and not very practical compared to other flights. The return flight had a wait of almost 45 min to get our bags.

The change was a little inconvenient, but I did it anyway. Three days later, I got another email notifying me of a change that required me to visit their website. Again, the change was inconvenient, but I accepted. Then another email came. At that point, I tried to contact their customer service department by email to work out what was going on. I didn't want to call their pay number from abroad for obvious reasons, but I kept getting emails notifying me of changes to my flight times without any response from their customer service department. It took multiple complaints to many different branches of the same airline before they finally sent me an email message essentially telling me that if I didn't like their service I could cancel the booking, by which time fares on that route had risen more than 40%. I raised this issue with them and, after many emails backwards and forwards, they promised to look into alternatives and get back to me.

85,south-african-airways,2015-01-05 00:01:00,,Flight SA 40 / 41 (JNB-VIC/VIC-JNB) SA 337 (JNB-CPT) SA 420 (PZE-JNB): overall not very satisfied - complicated reservation (system problems long waits at phone etc.) long waiting at check in no preferred treatment as Star Alliance frequent flyer most of the check in staff is unfriendly some even rude. Lounges are all low quality level and also here very unfriendly staff the food at the lounges is below average. On board the staff was mostly OK. Food on all flights was not good. Seat comfort on most flights not very good except SA 337 where they use the long haul aircraft so you have much leg room. Overall an airline which I cannot recommend - unfortunately there is not much alternative within the region.,,Business Class,,,2.0,no,,2.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,
86,south-african-airways,2015-01-05 00:01:00,,"JNB to IAD. Second time I have flown long-haul international with SAA and the second time I've had a good flying experience. Seats are older but very comfortable for a large man (6'4"" tall). Service in business class was superb. Smiles warmth and left us alone while we slept. The crew changed out in Dakar. The second crew was just as friendly and just as good.",,Business Class,,,5.0,yes,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,
87,south-african-airways,2015-01-05 00:01:00,,HKG-CPT via Johannesburg in economy. All flights on time and service was very professional. Was worried about not being able to make connecting flight to CPT while at JNB airport as the line was incredibly long but still managed to make good time. Cabin in JNB to HKG segment got a bit too hot and they obviously use their older aircraft to HKG. Inflight entertainment seemed a bit boring. Nonetheless I would fly them again.,,Economy Class,,,4.0,yes,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,
