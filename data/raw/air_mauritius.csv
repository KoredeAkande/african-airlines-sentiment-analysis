3,air-mauritius,2020-01-01 00:04:00,True,"Mauritius to London Heathrow This was an unexpected and emergency flight back home due to the Coronavirus and booked at very short notice following advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Mauritius due to the Border closures given the situation. In addition, the Kenya Airways / Qatar Airways flights to Nairobi and Doha / Manchester were all cancelled due to the Coronavirus, as the airlines were not flying on these routes, with no availability to travel until at least mid-April (this now appears unlikely as the Mauritius authorities have imposed restrictions). We were informed this was the last commercial flights to UK from Mauritius, so there was no option but to book and look to recoup costs back from Credit Card company give the crisis situation. This was reflected in the cost of the one way ticket to London Heathrow. Never have I seen Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport so deserted and quiet. However check in was easy. Boarding was a little chaotic, as this flight was full (this was a concern as it was impossible to evidence concepts of social distancing in the flight as would be expected given the impact of Coronavirus, though I wore a face mask for majority of the flight). Cabin crew themselves were dressed with appropriate Protective Equipment (PPE) for the 12 hour flight to reduce risks of infection. The flight itself represents an improvement from the last time I travelled with Air Mauritius some 25 years ago !. Cabin crew were kind, friendly and attentive and service has improved. The meals sadly are of poor quality. Lukewarm, with little in the way of decent portion size (though they provided my Vegetarian Special meal). Bread was stale unfortunately, and the dessert was an odd combination of rice and sugary milk ?? Menus were not provided, which is a shame. The inflight entertainment is ok, and the flight map and routing was good. Unfortunately could not connect to the complimentary WIFI online, as it would not recognise my booking details. In summary, definite improvements noted with Air Mauritius which was welcome. The new Airbus A330neo is a lovely aircraft. Pilot gave timely announcements. Sadly the toilets were not being attended to (perhaps more due to some of the ignorant passengers onboard whom have no empathy for the airline or the crew).The only deficits as mentioned was the meal quality, otherwise it was good. A great shame I could not get a connection back to Manchester (due to the Coronavirus, but good a rental car for a quick 3 hour drive to Manchester Airport from Heathrow to collect my car and get back home). I would travel with Air Mauritius again if need be - most likely from Mauritius to destinations such as India, Malaysia and local regional areas such as Reunion Island, Rodrigues and Seychelles. As for long haul, it’s ok, but 12 hours with Air Mauritius is a bit too much and will revert back to Qatar Airways or Emirates for future travel between Manchester and Mauritius.

We were nearly landing in Mauritius when the plane diverted to Madagascar due to a cyclone. Air Mauritius provided shuttles to an Ibis hotel, covered all the buffet meals while we were there (and accommodation). There was a lack of shuttle buses so many people had to wait long periods to reach the hotel. We took a taxi and paid ourselves, which was a great idea. The room and food was arranged without us requesting it, so we're grateful for that. Communication was good in terms of catching a flight the next day to Mauritius. Legroom was good on the flight. The food was inedible, which is my only complaint. Airline staff was lovely, friendly and accommodating.

7,air-mauritius,2020-01-11 00:01:00,True,"We were supposed to fly on 29th December. Due to a cyclone in Mauritius, the flight was first delayed, then eventually cancelled. Air Mauritius did inform us the first time, but the second time, everyone had already arrived at the airport. We were standing in line when we got notified that the flight was delayed, and then cancelled. Then we were informed at 1 am that the flight is scheduled for the 31st December at midday. We finally went through the boarding gates, took a bus to the aeroplane, and there we were - all standing on the 'runway' outside the aeroplane, waiting to board. We were outside for probably 30 minutes, then sat in the plain for another 40 minutes, without any communication about what is going on. When we finally took off, the captain apologised for the delay, but with no reason as to why. We had to ask the air hostesses every time if we needed something to drink and then they looked at us as if we were asking for something that was not allowed. They were unfriendly to us and not hospitable. When the food arrived, they ran out of the chicken option and only had fish left. My husband's fish was undercooked. When we arrived in Mauritius, we were once again stranded on the runway, without any busses, staff to communicate with or any means of getting into the airport. We were standing around for some time until we finally got picked up by one bus. We waited for more than an hour to get our luggage. On the flight back, although we were delayed by an hour, the service was a lot better. Drinks were offered all the time and the staff was friendly. Very inconsistent service. Air Mauritius did not contact us at all about the delay, asking if we would like to extend our stay or offer any discounts because we have now arrived almost 3 days later and missed out on the short time that we had on the island. Car hire was and accommodation was affected.

Check in process was slow with long queues, even though I was using the priority check in queue, only two desks were open to handle 4 Air Mauritius departures, in total the wait was around 40 minutes to check in, however when I finally got to the check in desk the process was efficient. The lounge experience is detailed separately. At the departure gate, the process was chaotic. There were 9 gate staff standing around but only two actually doing any work. The staff were unfriendly and didn’t want to engage with the passengers. They gave the impression that they didn’t want to be there doing the job and did not come up to the Air Mauritius standard for customer service. This lowers the overall rating given. The gate staff began releasing passengers before the crew were ready to receive them. I was the first passenger to the aircraft and had to wait on the air bridge for 5 minutes while the cabin crew finished their cabin preparations. Once on board, the cabin crew were what I had become accustomed to with Air Mauritius, they were friendly, welcoming and helpful and are a credit to the airline. This A340-300 was one of the refitted aircraft and the cabin was very nice. This aircraft now has lie flat beds in business and the interior is now similar to the A350, minus WiFi. Seats are comfortable. Food and beverage service was good and the food was surprisingly delicious. The departure time was 22:30 so it was late to eat a main meal, but non the less it was good.

I’ve read some bad reviews about the airline and its aging A340s, but I was pleasently surprised actually. The flight departed on time, and the loadfactor was around 70-80 percent. The legroom was sufficient, and the seats were comfortable with a nice headrest en decent recline. Even when the person in front of me reclined the seat I didn’t feel cramped. The only downside was the lack of IFE, as around half of the PTVs on board weren’t working. The cabin crew was very friendly and professional. Both meals were tasty (dinner and breakfast), but were a bit small. As I slept most of the flight I’m not sure how the service between the meals was.

I had 4 flights with Air Mauritius. 1 was cancelled without notifying me and then rebooked for a departure a day later, another delayed by 3 hours and the aircraft substituted with a smaller plane. As a result of the plane substitution, all pre-arranged seating allocations were scrubbed and worse seats allocated instead. The inflight entertainment didn't work and to top it off, my partner and I were asked by the purser to move so a 10 year old boy could sit in a very slightly different configured seat with his mother to the one that they had been allocated. No other passengers were asked to move. Ground crew and on board crew carried out their jobs in a perfunctory and robotic manner, going through the motions, but not really caring at all. The inflight fish curry meal was good. The web site provides limited and misleading (or no relevant information at all) particularly in relation to updated seating maps and airline lounge arrangements.. When I called the Service Centre I was told that when I arrived in transit from Australia into Kular Lumpur on an Air Mauritius code share I would have to collect my baggage and recheck it in. This was incorrect, as was the information I was told as to which airline lounge to use. All first world problems I suppose... and perhaps not the biggest of issues for an airline from the third world. Service was passable and safety good, but nothing more and cannot be recommended.

69,air-mauritius,2015-01-07 00:09:00,,"The seats on this Air Mauritius flight were old and grubby, and the leg room poor. A good point was the seating layout of 2x4x2. The staff were polite and reasonably helpful. The inflight entertainment was poor and the screen was so small I had to wear reading glasses to watch it. The worst thing was the food - on the flight from Heathrow to Mauritius the food was just about acceptable, but coming back was dreadful. The dinner we left most of it and the breakfast was so dreadful that neither of us ate it. We have flown with many different airlines, but none have been as bad as that. On the flight home we were delayed 29hrs and were not informed until we arrived at the airport, then we were taken to the Holiday Inn by the airport. There was no apology or compensation for this inconvenience",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Mauritius,July 2015,2,no,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,
70,air-mauritius,2015-01-20 00:08:00,,A truly awful experience and one as a family we have no wish to repeat by flying again. It was a daytime flight and all the cabin window shutters were kept down and the lights kept down so we flew in darkness - we asked the purser to put up the lights and blinds and we were told he could not do this. There was obviously bright sunshine outside but we were subjected to flying in darkness. The food was truly awful - I am not expecting haute cuisine on an economy flight but we were served pap. We have eaten good food in Mauritius but no attempt was made to serve reasonable food - no fresh fruit - it is a tropical island and I believe an attempt to serve a slice of pineapple is possible even on a tight budget but the salad that was presented was ghastly. The bread rolls were as stale as bricks on all three meals presented - watch your costs but don't bother presenting it to customers as a meal. Just because they have a tray to fill with their little boxes for a 3 course meal doesn't mean the customer should be treated as a fool! The whole experience was a shambles and can reflect on the island of Mauritius as a destination. The airline is getting it wrong by subjecting customers to this kind of service/experience in this day and age.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mauritius to London,August 2015,1,no,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,

However crew were helpful and fairly good for inflight service. Return leg did not meet my expectation - Air Mauritius delayed for 2.5 hours and was not helpful to change my connecting flight KL-Singapore.

74,air-mauritius,2015-01-08 00:05:00,,My wife and I booked business class from Cape Town via Mauritius to Paris (return). The 5.5 hour flight from Cape Town to Mauritius was essentially in economy seats with an arm rest in between the seats with a partial recline. The 12 hour flight from Mauritius to Paris in a A340 was in a reclining seat except that it is not flat so you end up sliding down the seat with your feet getting squashed against the seat in front of you. The airline assured us that this leg of our journey had flat beds which is certainly not the case. The inflight entertainment is a non entity and probably the worst we have experienced.,,Business Class,,,3,no,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,
75,air-mauritius,2015-01-04 00:05:00,,LHR-MUR return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect. We were originally flying BA until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to Air Mauritius which to be frank I was dreading! Check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect. As a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines. A real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok Emirates it wasn't. Once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesn't lie flat but sloping to the floor. I'm 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front I didn't sleep a wink all night. Having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldn't get our TV to work my husband slept most of the way I had a very long night. Return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through. Got the TV to work this time but film selection rubbish.,,Business Class,,,4,yes,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,

MRU - Perth (A330) full business with slight inclining beds. Service was good and the food lovely and plentiful with matching wines. Business lounge at MRU airport very good.

Much better than my previous flight NAI-MUR where I paid business fare to be seated on a coach seat (and the crew told me it has not changed): this is why I would not recommend this airline.,,Business Class,,,4,no,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,

When you get the water its in a plastic cup and its warm! Their own pre flight customer care video states that consuming water is suggested for all flights! If only you could get it. Then there was the seating smelly old uncomfortable and zero leg room. I am 175cm tall and I was looking for space! We flew overnight leaving at 22.00 and the lights in the cabin were off for all of 3hrs in a 8hr flight! What also annoyed us was excessive the use of the PA! They love it everyone has a go the captain the assistant the FA captain and assistant and the toilet cleaner.
