0,royal-air-maroc,2021-01-10 00:07:00,True,"The plane (737-800) was dirty and in bad condition on the inside, with bits of plastic insulation missing. There was a strong smell of toilet chemical and the seat tray and back of the seat in front was sticky. No PTV. The seats themselves were worn out and wonky. Casablanca airport was a hot disorganised mess, with confusing signs, long queues, nowhere to sit and buses that didn't seem to know where they were going. Food options there were overpriced and very poor quality. The domestic leg of my return flight was cancelled, adding an overnight stop in Casablanca. They ignored my emails and I had to call at 5am and hold for 30m to finally get through - the rest of the time they just hung up the phone and sent messages saying that they were busy. They agreed to change my ticket to a same-day connection on Turkish Airlines, which was 100 times better. The only thing I liked about RAM was the food, which was actually very tasty (delicious chicken or fish). They really need to update their interiors, employ more call centre staff and fix the horrible mess at Casablanca. Make it a place that is pleasant to transit, rather than a hassle. Also, it would be nice if they would stop cancelling flights.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Agadir to Istanbul via Casablanca,July 2021,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3,no

All I can say is , wow they have really improved. The airplane was brand new and quite comfortable. The flight attendants were very attentive and kind. The food was very good and every 2 hours they were bringing personal bottles of water. I would say if you had a bad experience in the past, definitely give them another try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Casablanca,June 2021,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
2,royal-air-maroc,2021-01-16 00:05:00,False,"Amazing airline. Highly recommended. I fly from Newark International to Casablanca International Airport on the 787-9 Dreamliner. We got good Legroom, Inflight entertainment with countless movies and many more! The food was the usual chicken, fish or beef, I got the standard beef. There was rice dessert and some drinks so it was like any other airline. Too me it didn't feel different and felt normal and it was pretty clean. Again recommended if your flying to Morocco or from Morocco choose Royal Air Maroc.

3,royal-air-maroc,2021-01-07 00:05:00,True,"I booked to fly to Sierra Leone (cost for 2 people, £1009) but due to the pandemic we weren't able to fly (flight was booked for Oct 2020, and was cancelled). So i called them and asked what we needed to do. I was told that as the tickets were non-refundable, I needed to pay a service charge (£306) to get a voucher for the flights (to the value of £1009). So i did. I received email confirmation, a receipt and a credit note for the £1009 to use against a new booking. But when I tried to use the voucher, they told me it wasn't valid, i can't use it, they have no record of it or me paying for it. When I try to sort this out, I am told I must email via the website, so I do. I receive an email back asking me to call. So I do. When i call, I am told they cannot talk to me, i must email, so I do, and i get an email asking me to call. So i try again, and get told I must email... and round and round it goes. No one will speak to me, and every email receives a reply asking me to call. I sent them the receipt and the voucher but they refused to look at it saying they have no record of it and would never charge for a service fee.  End result; no flight, no refund. I will never ever book with Royal Air Maroc again under any circumstances.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Freetown via Casablanca,October 2020,,,,,,,1,no
4,royal-air-maroc,2021-01-17 00:02:00,False,"As a frequent traveler, it should be disappointing to any travel related business to hear they are by far a customers worst experience. It's been nearly 1 year while I wait for ticket to be refunded, 1 year. Just a moment ago, I got off the phone during my once a week call to the Royal Air Maroc customer service, asking if perhaps this is the week they will do the right thing and give me my money back. Sadly, no this isn't the week. The nice lady on the phone informed me it's only been 3 months since receiving my refund claim and that due to covid, things can take a bit longer. Well, let's start with the fact that the airline never notified me of the flight cancellation, and made zero effort to communicate with me regarding the cancellation, or credit or a refund for 6 months after they cancelled the flight. Once I finally reached out via phone call and email, I waited another several months with no reply. At this point, obviously frustrated, I began calling back more frequently and was finally notified that my refund claim was filed incorrectly and I had to file it again. So now nearly 1 year later, while chatting with this nice lady on the phone, she tells me that since I've only waited 3 months since my claim was re-filed, I simply haven't waited long enough. How long is long enough? At this point, it's pretty clear that I was essentially robbed by this airline, and the most frustrating part is that every time I call asking when they will do the right thing, they just smile and keep lying more. Beyond awful service, companies like this should be pursued criminally. While I don't wish anyone to go through such experiences, one look at Royal Air Maroc online reviews and the story becomes clear. I'm not the first and won't be the last. But hopefully, through reviews such as this and those of others who've been cheated, people will eventually avoid, avoid, avoid, until Royal Air Maroc does right by its customers, or goes out of business. While I'm sure there are great staff working for this company and certain aspects of this review should probably be rated higher than a 0, I refuse to be treated this way any longer.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Geneva,March 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

If they can’t provide a service we paid for at lease refund back your client but do not promise to give a fake voucher or rebook and cancel flights whenever they want without letting you know and no proper answers or options. I was supposed to return to Dakar since May 22 and I am still here in Canada. 1 - Bad customer service, they never answer their phone here in Canada, I've tried 100 times a day over these past 5 days and nothing. 2 - Email reply, no accurate answers. 3 - do not provide you a flight option and the voucher that they are saying is valid for 18 months is fake which means you loose you money.

Our trip started in Miami with a final destination in Portugal, we had a stop in Casablanca where we changed planes and the luggage never got to Portugal. Instead, it stayed in Casablanca because of an airport strike from the employees of Royal Air Maroc. My bags along with the bags of many other people were left in Casablanca and I did not received my luggage until two days after. I had to go shopping for clothing and other things to be able to continue with my vacation. The customer service counter assured me that the money I spent would be reimbursed by the company. I tried to submit the papers the airline the day I left at the Royal Air Maroc counter in Portugal and they told me it had to be done in Casablanca because none in the Portugal counter could do it. When I tried to submit the papers to the counter in Casablanca they told me I needed to get outside the terminal and go to a special office because they could not do it either. I could not do it because I had to take the connecting flight to Miami and there was no time. When I arrived in Miami the counter for Royal Air Maroc there told me that they could not do it and that I needed to do it online. I had to call customer service multiple times and they never return my emails. At the end, after six months of wait time, they tell me I submitted the documents to late. All of that after they were the ones who did not answer owe despite me calling multiple times to check on the status of the claim. The only thing they said was that they had the documents and I needed to wait.

I went to the airport for my 7am flight. People were screaming at the counter staff. The flight was cancelled. They offered to bus me to Casablanca. I turned this offer down as I would not have made my connecting flight. Royal Air Maroc told me I would get a refund on my ticket.

We pleaded with them as it wasn't our fault and were told to leave the line and find a manager which we refused to do as we had no time. We explained the situation to them and no one wanted to help. Eventually we got the go ahead and were told to run to the gate. There were several more checkpoints to go through with long cues and no help. We had to run from point to point and when asking for help were just ignored.

They  gave us a form to fill out and it had a claim number spot. I asked for a claim number and he said to just call the number on the form.

43,royal-air-maroc,2018-01-24 00:11:00,True,"Marrakech to Doha via Casablanca. Marrakech to Casablanca was fine.  All fine there, apart from having to walk across the tarmac and use steps to board. Same in Casablanca. Then the nightmare started. Separating of passengers connecting to international flights and those terminating in Casablanca was done outside the rear entry doors to the arrivals terminal. Passengers were jammed up against the side of the building standing in puddles of water waiting to have their passport and ticket examined by one of two officials who told them to go through either the international connections door or the domestic arrivals door. When another bus of disembarking passengers pulled up, there was no room for them to get off the bus and stand safely out of danger from passing airport vehicles. It was slow-moving mayhem. I’d imagine that people with tight connections missed their flights. I had a 3-hour layover, so once inside the terminal, I settled down to wait for AT216 to Doha. Luckily I checked the gate number several times as it was changed without notice or announcement shortly before boarding. Again we had to walk across the tarmac and climb stairs to board. Everything seemed fine as we taxied down the runway - then sat for about 20 minutes. Eventually an announcement was made that we were going back to the terminal, and we taxied back. A hoist/lift was wheeled out to the right-hand wing and several mechanics peered at a central flap which was elevated, and made calls on their mobile phones. So we sat for 3 hours 45 minutes! No announcements were made, no refreshments were given, nothing! Eventually I went to the galley to get some water and asked one of the male flight attendants what was happening. I was told there was a “technical services” problem, but that we should be leaving within 15 minutes. Well, that never happened. By that stage, people were getting tired and irritable. The two small children in front of me were screaming and crying. People started sleeping across three seats if they had a row to themselves. Eventually we were told to prepare for takeoff. The man behind me was still sleeping across three seats as we started taxiing down the runway, one of the flight attendants saw him, shook him awake and told him to buckle up. No safety briefing was given as we were just about to take off. As we took off, I had a clear view out the window of the wing and the flap which was still elevated.  We made up 45 minutes in the air, but I still had to run through Doha airport to make my connection to Perth. I would never fly RAM again. I felt less than confident on a 6-hour flight with them as in my opinion the technical services issue did not appear to have been rectified.

You'll never get anything more than peanuts or pretzels on a domestic flight in America, so imagine my surprise! The flight attendants were polite, friendly, and courteous.

My issue started when I was refused boarding on my way back. The reason that was given to me was that the flight was overbooked and they looked for volunteers to take the flight the next day. As a solo traveller I agreed to collaborate to help out, even though I was a losing a day of work. I was given a paper with which I would have to claim a compensation when I would be back in my town. When I began the process back at home, it seemed to go well at first. They answered e-mails and they had to reimburse me 75% of my ticket cost. Then they made me give them my bank details and then I never heard from them again. I could not reach them or the line would be cut as when you call them, you're probably redirected to Morocco itself. It is very hard to hear and understand. The representatives are not very nice or patient either. I was directed to the local office in Montreal where the only lady working there never returned my messages and she is never there.

The flight from Luanda to Casablanca offered 2 meals which both consisted of a dry roll with a slice of processed cheese, a yogurt and a cold deformed muffin. The food to Monrovia was much better and of a much better quality. Also, the plane from Luanda was old and needed maintenance, and sitting close to the toilet with the broken door meant I could smell everything. I then had a 12 hour layover in Casablanca, but the transit hotel was full from when I landed at 10am which meant I had sit on the airport for 12 hours with no place to just relax. The flight to Monrovia was then delayed by 3 hours and staff not once told us why but rather got angry and argued with us for asking why it was delayed.

74,royal-air-maroc,2018-01-25 00:01:00,True,"Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca. I must say that this airline is very nice, and I have no hesitations using it in the future. Online service is a bit weird, because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly, the system selects them for you, and there seems to be no logic behind the selection. Moscow to Casablanca (5 hours 30 minutes, on-time) Check-in was a breeze. The flight was operated by a B737-800 with a nice modern interior and mood lighting, and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats - which has tons of legroom and very comfortable old-fashioned thick seat profile. Pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat - a rare sight! The flight was half-empty, so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone. The staff were polite and quite friendly, but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service - which is awfully long for a daytime flight. The meals - full trays with salads, desserts, bread and a hot main dish - were delicious, especially the pre-ordered seafood meal, even if the presentation was a bit lacking. They also had complimentary Moroccan wine in small glass bottles, which was very classy, as well as great in taste. Surprisingly, they served one more meal around an hour before landing, which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger. This is the first time I felt so full after the economy class flight, and that's a very rare thing nowadays. The plane had no personal entertainment or power ports, so consider bringing your own. Marrakech-Casablanca (40 minutes, on-time). Check-in was very fast once again, but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats, since she apparently did not have access to the system, and I have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion. The flight on an ATR72 was almost empty, with only 11 passengers, and the ATR72 was the most comfortable plane of its category I ever took. A lot of legroom once again. This flight features zero service, not even drinks, which I found surprising - they could have at least provided water. Not a big deal, considering it's just a short hop. Casablanca airport is not a great place for transit, but not the worst one I've been to (Rome Fiumicino, I'm looking at you). Long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere, but the waiting times were actually very small. Casablanca-Moscow (5 hours 40 minutes). The flight to Moscow was operated by a similar B737-800 and was jam-packed with transit passengers from Nigeria, and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized, with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding. Once onboard, I tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change, but he told us to wait until after take-off. I asked another one, and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful, and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable. Then we switched seats with some fellow passengers, that have also been separated by the weird Royal Air Maroc seat assignment system, and ended up in the bulkhead row. The service was similar to the first flight, but this time they even provided amenity kits - with eye masks and socks, and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of Singapore Airlines, for example. The food and wine were great again, and the luggage arrived safely.",Boeing 737-800 /  ATR72,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca,December 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,,5,yes

82,royal-air-maroc,2017-01-26 00:11:00,True,"Nice to Washington via Casablanca. Flight staff and airport not worthy of Boeing 787. Returning from 3 weeks in France we chose to fly from Nice to Casablanca and on to Washington DC on Royal Air Maroc because the second leg was on the Boeing 787. Boarding in Casablanca was confused, disorganized and perilous. As has become customary for international passengers flying to the U.S. we had a second security check at the gate where we were fully patted down and carry-on inspected. While the males were whisked through by two males, there were no female security guards. All the females had to wait nearly an hour before a female started their pat down and a similar delay until the entire line was cleared. Meanwhile the men and boys did not directly board the plane from our main terminal gate. No! We, and subsequently the women and female children had to descend three flights of dirty ill lit stairs, get on a bus and go to the old original terminal, climb three full flights of stairs to the gate and then board the plane. At check-in I had asked for my pre-ordered wheelchair as I've very limited eyesight (legally blind) and Vertigo and was told a wheelchair was not available. Stairs are a real challenge especially without my wife alongside and dependent on filthy banisters and just my cane. Our aisle seats on Boeing’s newest aircraft were comfortable, the coach class seat pitch was the usual 30” we find on most airlines. We had expected Moroccan style cuisine we experienced on an earlier trip to Morocco, but we received the same food Air Maroc served on the first leg from Nice. The cabin service was erratic and staff not at all customer-friendly. Midway through the flight we found that the rest rooms had no toilet paper, no towels, no Kleenex, and the refuse bin was overflowing. A few minutes later the captain came up the aisle going to the galley so I buttonholed him, described the conditions and stated that the cabin crew were disrespecting a new aircraft. The captain took a peek then stormed off. Shortly two male stewards rushed up with their arms loaded with paper products.

I was surprised that for the fare involved on the Agadir - Casablanca sector there was not even the offer of a glass of water, the curtain to the galley was across the whole time with the smell of food wafting through (crew meals obviously) disappointing service to be honest. The transfer at Casablanca was fine / the crew on the Casablanca - Madrid sector were very pleasant, the cabin lay-out was proper ""first class"" style seating plenty of leg room, magazines offered before take-off with pre-flight water or juice. As the flight was only 1 hour and 15, I was given a meal tray which had a hot beef shawarma with fruit salad and Mango mousse cake. It was delicious to be honest and a hot towel service after. The only thing I found really odd on this sector was there were no announcements made in English at all only French and Arabic (the safety demo was a video in English and Arabic) there were a few USA passengers on board also and we had to ask the crew what the announcements were about which I found odd. On the previous sector Agadir / Casablanca all the announcements were made in French / Arabic / English so I'm unsure as to what they were up to as the majority of passengers on the Casablanca / Madrid were Spanish or English speaking.

The personel of RAM told us this was normal procedure and once we would arrive in Casablanca, we would receive our next boarding pass for the plane to Nairobi. Once arrived in Casablanca (on time, still had more than an hour to get on the other plane), the personel of RAM showed us where to obtain our other boarding passes. At this desk they suddenly told us 'that plane left more than an hour early!'. So, as our first plane was landing, the other one was already taking off! Nobody notified us, not online, no e-mail, message. We were speechless and desperate. Together with an American couple (who also booked a direct ticket from Brussels to Nairobi), the personel told us it was no problem, they would refund our flight and that we would have to take the next flight, 2 days later! This was not an option for us, because we already booked a safari with driver and airport pick up, all planned from the moment we would arrive in Nairobi.

Our journey out of Doha was fine and there were no issues; once we got onto the aircraft we both slept most of the way. The return journey from Casablanca to Doha was however a little different and disappointing. The aircraft was dirty and the staff inattentive. I pressed my call button a number of times; staff did not come and were sat around at the back. Because of this, I got up and went to the back of the aircraft myself where I found staff disregarded me and other customers! Eventually a young man asked me what I wanted and I requested a glass of white and red wine. He immediately dismissed me and said he would have to check at the front of the aircraft and would bring the wine to me! I waited a long time. In the end, I went back to the rear and asked again - I chose the only steward who had been polite so far throughout the journey (who was the most accommodating on the flight) he asked me what I would like. I replied that I would like two glasses of wine: one for myself and one for my husband.

They are consistently the keenest pricing on this route and with RAM each time you make a booking it is like rolling the dice. The experience on the European facing routes is consistently good and the aircraft modern. On the African side the experience tends to be less good but still OK. Where the element of chance comes in is that if anything goes wrong with your connection in Casablanca then these guys just melt away - like snow in the Sahara - and you will be left without information, help, or any sense that there is any coherent policy for sorting things out. I had one horrendous experience when Heathrow was fogbound and the lack of information meant that when the flight eventually too off it did so without about 20 passengers. To their credit they did eventually get us to Heathrow later the same day to be reunited with our luggage which had gone on without us. Casablanca airport is just about OK for a short stopover - insufficient seating, lousy PA but fairly modern.

More than 3 hours of delay on the first flight, reason given: pilot was sick, then talks about a strike (no evidence anywhere of a strike, they said this to discourage people demanding their money back).  Missed corresponding flight in Casablanca. Only 3 people to help hundreds of stranded passengers to check for other flights or solutions. One person available to help for accomodation (a basic right when stranded for the night) for hundreds of passengers. This person is then clearly stalling the whole time and telling people: ""All of the hotels nearby are full. It's not worth it to book a hotel in town if you have a flight in 7 hours, etc"". Finally we give up. We stay the night in a cold airport. Next morning: finally the connecting flight. Upon arrival we notice our luggage was not on the flight (even after checking with several different people at Casablanca airport that the luggage would come). Nobody from Royal Air Maroc at Marrakesh airport. After an hour of searching somebody could verify our luggage was still somewhere in the system. It arrived at night, we had to take a taxi and lose more time. Finally,  when checking in for the flight back home we were told that our booking for the flight got automatically cancelled because there were problems with one or more previous flights. Nobody at the airport to help us, so we had to call the helpdesk and try and explain this whole thing. Told on the phone that somebody would call back with a solution. When they finally called back after more than an hour, ensuring us that we could now get on the plane, we were told in the airport that it was too late: boarding had closed.

Royal Air Maroc finally sent a representative to the gate after 1.5 hrs after the flight was meant to depart to sort passengers out with connections. After 2.5 hrs we spoke to staff who informed us that we had been rebooked a flight the next day and we needed to pick up our boarding passes and accommodation voucher from the transit desk in Casablanca.

I flew out of JFK on March 23 2017, flight AT201 with a connection in Casablanca. The crew were inattentive and unfriendly. It was mostly an all-male crew. My TV monitor’s sound did not work and after 2.5 hrs into the flight of trying to get it fixed and trying to get their attention I finally gave up. They would never answer my attendant call button. On the return home it was even worse, I flew out of Rome, connected in Casablanca and then to JFK. From Rome on April 3, 2017 I was supposed to leave at 6.20pm, but the flight I was told was delayed 15 minutes. Well almost a full 6 hours later they finally got us on a flight at 12.10 midnight to Casablanca. There was little to no communication as to why we were delayed nor what our options were nor updates. Once in Casablanca at 2.30am we were just let off the plane with no explanation as to what to do, where to go, who to talk to or nothing. We got to the customs area where they gave us tickets for our connecting flight (we missed the 1st connecting flight, which was supposed to leave 10.30pm out of Casablanca to JFK) so the next available flight was at 2.45 pm (a full 12 hrs later). RAM did not tell us we could get a hotel or even where to go to get a voucher, I stopped at an information booth and she told me where to go. I got the voucher and the shuttle bus to the hotel, which was 4.00am by that time and got to my room. On the flight back to JFK again the TV Monitor sound did not work, but I didn’t even try to get them to fix it based on the last flight. Again the flight attendants were inattentive and unfriendly.

I realised things were amiss when my coach pulled up to the plane and the lights were flickering on and off. There was an electrical fault, and the passengers were eventually sent back to the terminal. I can only assume all Royal Air Maroc staff then hid, as for the next 3 hours we were locked in the airport with no information and nobody to ask. There was a small passenger uprising, resulting in half the flight marching out of the airport. Chaos ensued and eventually at 4am a RAM representative arrived and directed passengers to a 'replacement coach'. When confronted by dozens of tired and angry looking passengers the surprised coach driver explained he was driving to Fez the next day, and we eventually established no replacement coach had been arranged. More chaos followed, followed by a 4 hour ride in a 1950s taxi eventually arriving 9:30am with no sleep. RAM promised compensation, but never paid and don't respond to e-mails.

There was a line in the accommodation desk of RAM in Casablanca but it moved quickly, and I was put in a very nice hotel during my 15 hour layover, with dinner and breakfast included. My bags arrived normally in Geneva. No delays in any two flights. Problems with RAM though: the food is horrible, especially on the longer flight. Although the flavor was okay, it was very poorly presented, overall low quality, and not something you would expect at an airline. No alcoholic drinks on board, no snacks or extra beverages in between meals. Staff in the longer flight seemed impatient and not very willing to help. Bathroom was a bit dirty as well. On the shorter flight food was a bit better but still poorly presented. Staff was a lot more professional. My ticket was not cheap at all.

After a 4 hour transit in a very dirty airport, the flight took off on time for Accra. Food and beverage selection was ok considering that only breakfast was served with nothing being offered on the Accra to Monrovia route. The fun started on arrival in Monrovia as one suitcase was missing. The necessary lost luggage form was filled in and submitted. After a week's interaction with RAM Monrovia office, the lost suitcase has neither been traced, found or delivered. A RAM employee confirmed that because RAM flights are very full, not all check-in luggage is loaded onto the aircraft which leads to inevitable delays and great frustration at the destination. In fact, the city office of Royal Air Maroc in Monrovia has turned into a heap of lost luggage and irate passengers have to daily go and search for their own luggage as RAM never returns any calls not appears to follow up on any enquiries.

All aircraft had extremely generous legroom and the food on board was of a high standard, including alcoholic drinks. The cabin crews were all very professional and courteous. The only slight complaint onboard was that the IFE system on the B767's was rather temperamental and prone to resetting quite often, which made it impossible to watch movies. RAM accommodate transit passengers free of charge in a central Casablanca hotel if you have a long layover, which is fine and a nice touch, but can end up being rather fraught and stressful by the time you have travelled to/from the hotel and had to deal with the nightmare of negotiating the semi-organised chaos at CMN airport.

Not too disorderly so enjoyed that. Flight attendants were great and welcoming. Took off early and 2 1/2 hour flight to Casablanca. Delicious Moroccan chicken dinner was served with 2 drink runs. No sound available so they showed Bugs Bunny cartoons on the screens with no sound - sort-of strange. Why bother showing them at all? Just show the moving map - which they didn't have either. Landed on-time and bussed to the main terminal where the transit security line was insane. Be prepared for these kind of lines in western Africa and for disorder as passengers push and shove to get to the front. Dakar flight boarded with confusion as many carry-on's were too large for the overhead bins. So we were stuck on the jet-bridge as every passengers carry-on was evaluated. On-board it was a crazy free-for-all with people just sitting anywhere they wanted. Then when the passenger assigned to that seat came they either made the person move (as I did to the guy in my seat) to just grabbing an open seat - which then made the passenger in that seat make them move or look around. It was chaos but funny - the flight attendant saw me laughing and joined in - was just crazy. Ended up with a seat next to me open which was really great!

In our case, on return, this gave rise to a situation where travellers already on board began to negotiate with other passengers of the changes of places to be seated together. There were people who marched in the aisles to their new seats at cross-purpose of those who where boarding with their carry-on baggage. General confusion!

34,royal-air-maroc,2015-01-05 00:10:00,,"Absolute Nightmare. the Royal Air Maroc flight from JFK to Casablanca was OK. Flight from Casablanca to JFK was supposed to be at 2:55 pm Saturday. A morning check of website and email showed that flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for a flight at 12:30 am. Sunday. Shortly later received an email that it was rescheduled for 4:00 .m. No further emails and website still showed 12:30 am. Got to airport for 4:00 am. flight and found out that it had been rescheduled for 7:00 am. Luckily our tour guide was still with us and he got them to give us a hotel room for a few hours. Boarded on time but then sat in the plane for an hour waiting for every connecting flight to arrive in Casablanca. Then 20 minutes more while they found and removed the luggage of two people who did not arrive (no complaint about that - welcome safety measure). Finally left at 8:20 am. 17+ hours late. During the whole time on the ground and for the first hour or so of the flight there were 5 or 6 children screaming constantly at the top of their lungs. The parents apparently didn't feel any need to try to quiet them. The screaming combined with the nice Moroccan music played while on the ground it made it impossible to read, sleep, or listen to an audiobook. To top it off, US Customs forms were only provided in French so returning US citizens who couldn't read French had to find another passenger who could translate the form for them. In general, this airline is not up to the standards of other airlines. Boarding is just rushing to get near the front of the scrum so as not to be last to board. At JFK this got you onto the jetway but in Casablanca you then had to carry your heavy carry-on down a long flight of stairs, board a bus, and then carry the heavy carry-on up the shaky stairs to the plane (probably an airport not airline issue). JFK to Casablanca, flight attendants did nothing to ensure efficient use of overheads. No announcement about a 45 minute gate hold at JFK. Announcement in Casablanca that plane was being held for connecting passengers was not made right away. Food was skimpy. Nothing on tray to drink. Served coffee and tea after a while but water wasn't brought until after food was eaten. They didn't come around with water during flight but if you knew about it you could go back to the galley and help yourself to water. No beverage service on Casablanca to JFK flight until just before arrival after the dinner trays were given out. By the way, don't buy water at the Casablanca airport to take on the plane. They have security people at the gate go through your luggage to take it away or force you to drink the whole thing right there. There are three security checks: one to get into the airport, one to get into the passenger only gate section, and one at the gate. Don't get rid of your water until the last one. We got rid of the water that we had with us at the second security check then paid $3 for a 50 cent bottle of water to take on the plane but had to give it up or drink it up at the last security check. I had to drink the whole thing there in order to have the empty bottle.
