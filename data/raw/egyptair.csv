They emailed me that it was cancelled and that I could reschedule my flight using their customer support service or a nearby Egyptair office. The customer support service never answered and left me hanging for so long that my call credits ran out and there is no Egyptair office close to where I live.

I called the Head office in Johannesburg where they told me that flight is still on, but my tickets is been cancelled without them knowing whats going on. I called the head office where I was told that my tickets been cancelled because its coming from South Africa and we are not allowed into Dubai. But I told them that I'm Emirati citizen and its stating in Egyptair website that Emirati are excluded and we can enter UAE without any problems. They agreed on that and told me my business tickets were taken by someone else and only economy seats are available for the 7th May. Or I can reschedule my flight for the 14th after Eid. I told them that I booked and fully paid my 4 business tickets for the 7th as its even more expensive than the 14th because of Eid season and I would like my business tickets back as I didn't cancel or request cancelling and I still wants my tickets. Long story short, I wasn't given my business tickets and I had to fly economy class despite paying full amount a week before for business seats.

4,egyptair,2021-01-01 00:04:00,False,"On March 30, 2021, I arrived at Washington Dulles airport to catch flight MS932 to Cairo Egypt. When I arrived I observed a chaotic situation without any social distancing and barely any resemblance to crowd control or customer service. There were many passengers that did not have their Covid-19 negative verification certificate printed out. Because we are in the digital age I can understand why passengers would assume that they would be able to just show an agent digital results on a mobile device. The agents were requiring passengers with their results on digital devices to print them there at the counter, Egyptair had a single laptop with a malfunctioning printer at a counter that all of the passengers had to share. Again, there was not any social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no assistance for passengers who were not computer literate and the male ticket agents had extremely bad attitudes. This created a situation of chaos. As a result of all of the chaos, some passengers missed the closing of the boarding gate including myself. I was told that I would not be able to board the flight and I was offered to have the flight rebooked for free. The gentleman at the counter told me that I would not have to pay a change fee. When I got to the counter to arrange for a new flight the attendant who was making arrangements for other passengers was charging what he called an upgrade fee. I watched him as he did this to three different passengers, with each of the fees being different for each passenger sitting in the same section. It was now my turn. He told me that I had to pay a fee. I asked, ""What is the fee for"". He said that it was upgrading the service. I then asked him what are the upgrades and what do I get. He looked surprised that I asked that question and had no explanation for it. I then asked him will I be getting something extra and will I be able to pick my seat as I did on my original booking. He said no. He seemed to be angry and told me if I did not want to do that then I should call customer service in New York. I left the airport and called New York customer service and I was on the phone stuck on hold for approximately two hours before I was disconnected by their telephone system. I had no better luck with their customer service. Today March 31, 2021, I once again tried to contact the ticket agent and customer service by phone with the exact same results. I now have a return flight two weeks from now which I will not be in Cairo to fly on. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had.

It took them 4 hours to give us proper information. They told me they would put me on the CAI to ADD flight the next day (24 hours later). 45 min. before departure the Egyptair transit desk told me that I could not board because my Covid-PCR test had expired. 30 min. before departure they realized that it was a mistake, because they had confused the day of the test with the day of my birthday. By that time, the boarding of the flight had closed. It took another 6 hours for Egyptair to figure out where I could do a new test. I got a special permission to do it within the terminal and had to pay EUR 90. I never received a receipt for this test although I asked several times. By that time, I had spent 34 hours in the transit terminal, without proper information, without accommodation, without communication (there is only 30 min. free internet). It was very cold and they did not even give us a blanket. On 01/10 at 12.30 pm I was put up in an airport hotel. I was rebooked on a flight CAI–NBO–BJM 2 days later. I left CAI on 01/12 9.30 pm and arrived in BJM on 01/13 10 am. The scheduled arrival was 01/09 1 pm, 4 days earlier. Of course, my luggage did not show up and I put in a claim. It finally arrived in BJM on 01/21, with a delay of another 8 days. Egyptair (in the transit terminal in CAI) was not helpful at all. The staff was extremely rude, impolite and incompetent. They took our passport “to process the new tickets”, they let little children sleep on the floor without even a blanket, and no warm meal in nearly 35 hours, not able to communicate with anyone with only 30 min. free Wifi.

8,egyptair,2021-01-09 00:02:00,True,"We were disappointed with the customer relations and handling of problems with our flight. The plane was clean and comfortable, and we received waters and hand sanitizer upon boarding. However, our flight to Cairo from Luxor was canceled two days before the flight while we were already on our trip. In the case of our traveling companions, they never received confirmation of their cancelation (different flight a day later, but same story). The new flight they put us on would not work with our itinerary, but after trying to get in touch with them at short notice, none of their numbers worked. We finally found a number that worked, but they were unable to help us much. They finally put us on an earlier flight the day before, causing us to lose an entire day of our vacation, but would not compensate us for a lost day of our itinerary. After asking, they refused to upgrade our seats. They also would not let us check in online, and so after arriving at the airport, we found out the new flight they put us on is not even a direct flight and was a multi-stop flight back to Cairo. Now we must find a hotel or place to stay in Cairo for the night since we are getting in 25 hours earlier than our itinerary. While this is obviously not the company’s fault, this demonstrates a lack of hospitality and willingness to help make a bad situation easier on us due to their cancelations.

Check-in on the counter was pretty smooth - cannot say the same for the app. First leg was pretty full - anout 80-85%, we left Entebbe with a slight delay. Was lucky that I was in a window seat with nobody next to me, so the flight was pretty comfortable. The food was ok - water, juice, 2 small baguettes (1 cheese + 1 chicken) & chocolate cake. Prepacked and really quick to hand out. It is known that they are non-alcohol, but they also did not offer coffee or tea. Cabin crew did the service quickly (food, covid measures and immigration info) and then came out again before landing. The transit time was pretty tight (1 hour) and with a short delay I doubted I would catch the next flight. Cairo airport is not that big, but finding your way when hurried can be hard. After going to the transfer desk I was rushed to my next flight which had almost boarded. With the assistance of the ground crew me and another fellow passenger made it.

My comments - 1) The boarding facility at Abu Dhabi airport was total confusion!

Every time I asked for something I was looked at as if I had annoyed the crew! 3) The inflight service provided from Cairo to Abu Dhabi was no different from the above.

37,egyptair,2019-01-17 00:11:00,True,"Bangkok to London via Cairo. Check in at Bangkok was quick with no queues in all classes. The new Thai lounge was right across from our gate, and is a big improvement from most of their lounges. The lounge is huge. Boarding was disorganised, with door A for economy and door B for business when normally it is the other way around, leading to confusion. There were also Egyptian security agents checking details at the gate in Bangkok. I received a warm welcome on both flights and found my seat. Bangkok flights really should get an aircraft upgrade. The A330 is not suitable for this route. The seats in business and economy are only mid-haul quality, but the flight is 10 hours long which makes it a long-haul flight. The seat on the 777 is much better. They’re both angle-flat seats, but the 777 has more pitch, which means your legs aren’t shoved into some tiny compartment under the seat in front. On the A330 this at least has the slight benefit of having the TV screen closer to you, unfortunately the headphone jack was not working. I didn’t mind as I caught some much-needed sleep. Entertainment was rather spoilt for choice but I don’t like the lack of action movies. The amenity kit given on both flights were an improvement from last year, with Aigner lotions and potions as well as some nicer amenities. Food wise; I had ordered a gluten free meal but the flight attendants came around with normal meals and asked if I would prefer to have those instead. All the food was really good but their starter should be more creative, the only appetiser choice was smoked salmon and prawns on all flights. Cairo has a large number of transit passengers, and you clear security at the gate before boarding which makes it a very easy transfer. The newer lounge called Alioth which recently opened is very preferable to the older lounges, namely Almesian. My seatmate used the latter and he described it as a crowded mess. My lounge experience was pretty good but nowhere near the best. My favourite bit about flying Egyptair is that their arrival time into Heathrow is the least busy time of the day, at 1pm, and immigration was deserted. I had a pretty good experience with Egyptair and they have improved a lot since last year and I have easily taken notice.

However, my business class experience was way below my expectations. Crew's grooming were not really neat, there was no sense of welcome throughout the flight. They were chatting away in the galley, ignoring passengers most of the time.  Crew did the bare minimum, there was no smile, they weren't engaging or pro active, from the pursers to junior crew.  Since no menu was provided, crew didn't explain what's available in terms of beverages. I had to ask, and it was apparent that they weren't interested to inform me what's available, I felt every little request I made was a huge bother to them. Came meal time, all 3 choices were brought in front of me (instead of using a cart), I had to make a quick decision. I was asked to take the chosen meal from the tray she held. (it's a hot plate btw). No after dinner coffee or tea was offered. Dessert was offered on one sector but not the other.. Crew didn't check for safety procedures during landing and take off on one flight, there were a few passengers still asleep with window shut and flatbed position. This really bothered me and raised all the red flags for safety concerns. There was hardly any announcement from the cockpit about the flight, and info of arrival destination.

42,egyptair,2019-01-14 00:10:00,True,"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Cairo. I've flown a couple of times with this airline - bought a couple of tickets all at once because they were very reasonably priced. In all honesty: I so much regret doing this. On short-haul flights Egyptair has terrible seats in BC; these are very hard and I need to put a blanket under me to sit on. The long haul flights - done A330 and B777 - have seats that not go entirely flat and when sleeping on your side as I do, it messes up your spine. Overall: the planes are just like the lounge in Cairo dirty. Usually, I use the wet tissues to wipe my armrests and they turn black. Also when in the bathroom of the plane, the shelves are black of all sorts of dirty stuff. Staff usually want to do their best, but it all is very clear that they seem to be totally unexperienced or just not a 100% fit for their job. This already starts with small things where I get extremely annoyed with everyone sleeping during the flight and then when sitting at row 4 I still clearly hear staff having their ""tea party"" conversations and laughs. It would be nice that like in other airlines you would have some sense of your paying customers wanting to have a sleep. Food on board seems to have quite a variety - on the short-haul flights it is always terrible while on long haul it seems to be OK-ish, but also not more than that.

Our flights had been booked on Egypt Air. The agent who’d arranged the logistics of our journey assured us that Egypt Air was a decent airline and that our journey would be pleasant. We trusted him, since the journey to Medina, via Cairo, had been pleasant enough. We weren’t overly concerned about the 23 hour layover in Cairo that loomed ahead of us on the return leg. He guaranteed us that EgyptAir would arrange accommodation for our group and that we’d be issued transit visas which would allow us to do a bit of sightseeing before setting off for home. The children were especially excited about this. A chance to see the pyramids! When we stood in the queue at their passport control, never had I encountered an immigration official this rude! He demanded that transit passengers sit down! So we sat. We were a fairly large group, it turned out. Twenty five South Africans and a smattering of Nigerians.  Anticipating a long-ish wait, we got comfortable. Greeted our fellow wayfarers, shared what food we had among us and waited. It was two hours before a bus was sent to collect us.

The flight had very comfortable seats for a two to three hour flight. Cradle type, just two seats beside each other in business much better than the usual tight European business class.

65,egyptair,2018-01-08 00:12:00,True,"Bangkok to London via Cairo. I was originally booked in business class for this flight, but I had to change my flight and ended up getting downgraded to economy. At Bangkok airport, there was a line for Business class passengers that looked rather long. Boarding was relatively organised, although I did manage to get on ahead of those seated in my zone. After takeoff, the crew dragged meal service for an hour and a half.  On this flight, the catering was provided by Thai, and was the same thing I got on my flight to London with Thai. The only difference being served a salad with a hideous dressing instead of a meat appetiser. After meal service, I attempted to sleep. I was in the middle row, and there was two of us, my seatmate was on the right aisle and he slept in his seat without any problems. Even though I had three seats to myself, I couldn't get good sleep on this flight. The recline was too little. Ultimately I did manage to go to sleep after an hour trying to find a good (and awkward) position. A good feature of the seat is the footrest. A bad feature of the seat is the minimal head support, and I found myself wrestling with the headrest during boarding trying to get it up. They also gave us amenity kits. Which were the same amenity kits given to business class passengers.  Transit is a good experience in Cairo, as you go through security at the gate. Unfortunately, something that didn't happen on my outbound flight was an organised boarding. They shouted ""Bangkok"" and people went sprinting to the gate. This time, they shouted ""Business Class"" and let business class passengers get on first. I was quite cross since this didn't happen when I flew Business. On this flight, I found myself calling the flight attendant repeatedly as my seatmate (Not travelling with me) was not served a snack when everyone else was served one. One of the funny things that happened on this flight was that there was a crying baby, but no one seemed to mind, including myself.  I am not very happy with my Egyptair experience, and I'd take my word back where I said I would be alright to fly with them in business class, rather, I'd probably choose another Star Alliance carrier in future. Egyptair is quite a rubbish choice, and I wouldn't fly them again in economy, but I might consider their business class in the future.",A330-300 / Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Cairo,December 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2,no,1.0,2.0

67,egyptair,2018-01-21 00:11:00,True,"London to Bangkok via Cairo. I was quite sceptical when I booked Egyptair, their reviews weren’t fantastic but I booked them on the basis that they were a star alliance member (I needed the miles) and also because of a very cheap ticket (£1250). At Heathrow airport, I arrived 6 hours early for my flight (I do this often) as I wanted to avoid the rush hour Piccadilly line to Heathrow. I used the self check in desks however they didn’t work as well as my bag tag was printed but not my boarding pass. But the friendly Check in agent was able to print out my boarding pass. Air Canada lounge in Heathrow was really good, food offering was plenty and seats weren’t an issue. Boarding was relatively organised however a bit sluggish. There was an odd choice of drinks, strawberry juice (which has whole strawberries inside) and pineapple juice. We had a slightly late departure but not too bad. Food on this flight was relatively good, although I think I may have chosen the wrong main course, as the other options sounded better. The fish and prawns were a bit dry, but nothing too bad. The big issue was that my seatmate (not travelling with me) was given a vegan special meal he didn’t order. The seat was comfortable, and there was lots of legroom! Everything was where it needed to be, and the recline was plenty. Entertainment was alright, not too good but could be better. The crew on this flight were absolutely fantastic. The purser (with 38 years experience) was amazing. She provided such good service that most of the passengers couldn’t resist giving her a handshake as they left the aircraft. Transit in Cairo is chaotic, but you only need to clear security at the gate. The first lounge I went to was a smoking lounge (the entire airport already smelled of cigarette smoke) then the second was a similar story, after which I was directed to a non smoking lounge, small, and some people couldn’t sit together. Food offering wasn’t bad and I didn’t go hungry for my red eye flight. This time, the crew dragged dinner service for two hours after departure, and I had to skip dessert (luckily I ate in the lounge). The seat on the A330 is noticeably smaller than the 777. It’s the same seat compressed into a smaller cabin. Legroom was decreased and the seat recline slightly decreased. Departure was delayed by half an hour and flight time was increased by half an hour, which meant I had to run through Bangkok airport to connect to another domestic flight. The crew on this flight were a little less friendly than the London flight, but still proved to be professional. The seat was angled flat, which sounded good for me in theory, but wasn’t too comfortable as i spent the same amount of time trying to fall asleep as i would’ve if I’d have been sat in an premium economy seat. WiFi was offered at an expensive price, so I chose not to use it. Overall, i am quite satisfied with my Egyptair experience, and would certainly fly them again for the price offered as they have drastically improved from the last time I flew with them. There are still some old school charms about flying them, especially the way they present their meal service. The main reason I chose Egyptair was that they are a star alliance member. Although, I would more likely choose a different airline for long haul solo travelling as I would prefer a 1-2-1 business class.",Boeing 777-300ER / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Bangkok via Cairo,November 2018,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes,2.0,3.0

I've flown Egyptair many times and hated it every single time, however, the same can simply not be said for this journey.

A very welcome upgrade from the then days of Egyptair's infamous drop down TVs. The selection of movies etc was pretty average but better than nothing at all so I'm not complaining. Egyptair's staff (most of them) seem to be from the stone ages and goodness knows they ain't going to win any beauty pageants but are so much more courteous than the 'pretty face but cold attitude type' flight attendants of many airlines. I personally feel that because English isn't their first language, some of their responses may seem rude, but yes, there is no denying that they have improved tremendously. Seats were comfortable enough for Economy class and had sufficient legroom. The food was also was not too bad and actually edible. They even served us with metal knives and forks. Cabin cleanliness was good and lavatories were like any other airline I've flown. The best part, however, was Egyptair's flight crew.

Then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical problem and will be sorted in 5 minutes, those 5 minutes turned into 2 hours and all passengers were getting apprehensive as the crew kept on saying 5 minutes and then we were told to disembark. So everyone got out of the plane and within literally 5 minutes we were all called back on, saying the flight is now ready. We all boarded and guess what sat in the flight again for two hours with the same 5 minute story. At 12.30pm we were told the flight is now cancelled and to disembark again and would be given more information outside. We waited for another 1 hour for our bags and the crew told us that they are trying to get another flight on the same day (Saturday) or we wait will Monday to fly out as they don't fly on sundays. Considering we were coming back on Tuesday that was a pointless option, we then spoke to the Egyptair Nairobi Airport Manager who said there was no way we would fly on the same day so we had to wait till Monday. His assistant told us that there was an Ethiopian airline flying in a couple of hours if we wanted to take that and then return with Egyptair on Tuesday as schedules. They agreed to the same and signed our ticket for a full/part refund. We even double checked with him if we flew with Ethiopian airline one way to Cairo would Egypt air refund our one way ticket - to which he said yes and even spoke to our travel agent on the phone. We then took the Ethiopian airlines (paid extra) and reached Cairo. Its an amazing city with amazing people. On the way back on Tuesday, Egyptair had cancelled our return so we had to get that sorted and after another 3 hour wait in the flight due to mechanical fault again the flight took off and got to Nairobi not forgetting we reached work late on Wednesday because of the flight delay. Back in Nairobi when our travel agent asked for the refund to get sorted from Egyptair, it took them a month to reply and they said they will not refund our one way ticket.  This is the most ridiculous customer service we have ever received especially after all the inconveniences caused to us by Egyptair. Wasted 8 hours at the airport, had to take another flight and spend extra money and not one person from Egyptair apologized or even cared. A good number of us used Ethiopian airlines that Saturday as Egyptair promised a refund.  It is the most horrible airline and I would not recommend anyone to travel with it.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to Cairo,June 2015,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,
58,egyptair,2015-01-29 00:06:00,,Seat is comfortable and service was surprisingly good. Food was also good. Lack of good entertainment and poor pilot announcements is a disadvantage.

59,egyptair,2015-01-04 00:06:00,,I consistently use Egyptair to visit family in France and the UK. It is my favourite airline because of the comparatively low ticket prices ability to change route and dates on tickets on even the cheapest tickets (also refundable) booked directly with the airline and the 46kg baggage allowance where other airlines only permit 20kg. The CAI-CDG and CAI-LHR routes are mostly served by newer Airbus 330s which are vastly superior to the old Boeing 777s. Pay attention to the aircraft type which is displayed when booking on the Egyptair site. I would not travel on a 777 with a young baby for instance as there is nowhere to place the bassinet except on the floor by your feet and they do not allow you to bring a car seat. There are also no infant seat belts as they claim these are unsafe. The 330 in contrast is pretty comfortable with a wide choice of inflight entertainment and good leg room in the front row. Food is fine. Kids meals are larger than the adult meals and are usually pasta with tomato sauce plus grilled chicken breast. Adult meals are bread roll plus butter with a main meal of rice plus meat plus sauce. You have a choice of red meat chicken or fish. The dessert is usually inedible and 80s looking. Staff have always been polite and accommodating especially when I was flying alone with young children. It is certainly not a premium airline but if cost and flexibility matter to you then I would recommend them for shorter flights. Take care always to book directly with them though so tickets are refundable.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes,,4.0
60,egyptair,2015-01-31 00:05:00,,LHR-CAI-JNB and return. Both ways the aircraft to and from London to Cairo was much newer than that from Cairo to JNB and back to Cairo. When did they ban smoking on aircraft? The flights from Cairo to Joburg still had ashtrays in the seats and toilets! The food was awful the worst that I have ever had on a flight from England. The staff were efficient enough but smiles were few and far between. I am going back to Turkish.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no,,2.0
61,egyptair,2015-01-29 00:05:00,,"JFK (NY) to Jeddah via Cairo on May 26th. I travel every 6 weeks from New York to Saudi Arabia. This was my first and most definitely the last time on Egyptair. Unfortunately I have nothing positive to say about this airline. Business class seat was OK but the service and food was horrible. If you have flown with premium airlines like Qatar and Emirates then you are in for a shock. After getting on the plane no one acknowledged or welcomed me during the whole flight. After 20 minutes I was offered a hot ""paper towel"" followed by a choice of orange or guava juice. No one even said Hello to me during the whole flight. Food was served in a rush. Horrible dried out food. No snacks during the flight. Bags of nuts were distributed when plane was about to land at Cairo. Breakfast was worse than the dinner. IFE was not good at all with cheap head sets. Amenities bag was actually a zip lock bag. My completely unbiased advise - stay away from this airline.",,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,,2.0
62,egyptair,2015-01-27 00:05:00,,Flew from Athens to Cairo and back. Aircraft I flew one of the very few Egyptair planes I have seen which still had the old paint scheme giving you some idea of the age of the plane. Inside aircraft upholstery did seem rather old and there were scratch marks on the wings and engines. No inflight entertainment system. Food was pretty good and cabin crew welcoming and pleasant. Boarding starts 1 hour before take off in most cases so hold this in mind when planning a journey. There was not much room in the seat and I felt cramped. When I transferred to another airline to catch my connection I appreciated just how cramped Egyptair was.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3,no,,1.0
63,egyptair,2015-01-20 00:05:00,,Flight 848 May 13. Flight 753 May 16. My recent flights experiences with Egyptair Business class were very positive. I had much more space and better food than on recent flights with American and BA. All flights were on time and the service was excellent. The flights attendants were positive. Both cabins were clean and there were English newspapers/magazines. I watched a total of four recent movies and had no complaints with the entertainment system. Additionally there was more than enough food offered during the flight. Since I do not drink alcohol I had no issues with their beverage selection. Both lounges Casablanca and Cairo were adequate. I had Internet access and a seat. The lounge staff in CAI were very nice and I enjoyed a coffee and croissant before departure. The restrooms were clean. My only concern was the boarding process at CAI. Although check in and security through business class were fairly easy I found the boarding process at the gate very disorganized. Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to your gate! Once onboard - piece of cake. EgyptAir offers a strong product at a good rate. I will definitely use their business class for future trips to No Africa.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes,,4.0
64,egyptair,2015-01-04 00:05:00,,My family flew from Toronto to Luxor (via Cairo) in business class. I was a bit concerned prior to departure after reading some of the other comments from travellers on this site. I must say I was completely satisfied with the service on the four legs of our flight. The planes are a bit old but the service was good. The staff were excellent (especially in Luxor). Everyone went the extra mile to make our flights as comfortable as possible. This is not a 5 star airline but we knew that before we departed. I think Egyptair is a solid airline and worth the cost of the tickets.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes,,2.0

MS911 DXB-CAI was on Boeing 777-300 seats are very hard and not comfortable at all flight was full red eye flight food was a tasteless omelette toilets were filthy. Crew seemed tired and not interested in their job and didn't follow safety procedures. Passengers stood up even before the plane stopped and crew didn't ask them to sit down. CAI-SSH was on express brand small E-170 45 mins flight was ok however not fond of leather seats plane was very cold return SSH-CAI was same CAI-DXB was a better flight not full over night so I slept most of it. Food was horrible entertainment was limited however with private screens on each seat but not much choices. Crew were ok however still not paying attention to safety procedures plane was taking off and the passenger behind me was talking on her phone. However price was very good.

This time the airbus 330 was a very old version direct flight of 10.5 hours almost no entertainment - only one TV for each section no phone charger so I had to give my phone to the flight attendant to charge for me.

68,egyptair,2015-01-23 00:01:00,,Amman to Cairo and Cairo to Copenhagen. By far the worst airline I have experienced the flight was delayed from Amman with no explanation given. When we finally boarded into the flight the staff did not even smile let alone make conversation with passengers. As a vegetarian I was shocked to know that they have no vegetarian options and the female attendant gave me a dry response by saying that its not their fault that I am a vegetarian. While leaving the plane all the cabin crew did was give passengers an icy stare - no smile or thank you. Its such a shame about the cabin crew because the flight was otherwise very clean modern with plenty of legroom and comfortable seats.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,,2.0
69,egyptair,2015-01-05 00:01:00,,Flew London-Addis Ababa and transited in Cairo. The Lond-Cairo leg was OK the plane on the Cairo-Addis leg was pretty old and there was no in-seat entertainment system only a rolling film on shared TV sets. Neither flight back had in-seat entertainment. On the Addis-Cairo leg we got diverted to Aswan due to sandstorms at Cairo. We spent 3 hours in the plane on a taxi-way with virtually no information from the crew. I'd go as far as to say they were rude - they played cards and joked at the back of the plane whilst passenger had to buzz and ask for water. The delay resulted in a missed connection at Cairo. We were boarded on another EgyptAir flight but were given nothing in the way of food etc despite out arrival in Heathrow being delayed 10 hours in total. Lack of internet access at Cairo terminal made it very difficult to make plans for the unexpected late arrival in Heathrow (Sunday at 10pm). Having seen the poor way problems were dealt with on this flight I would not use this airline again despite the relatively low ticket cost. Aircraft were also very basic.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1,no,,1.0
